# The complete project ðŸŽ‰

**Congratulations, you completed this workshop!** âœ¨

Always remember that type-safety should be your friend while creating Dart or Flutter apps. Whether it's Firestore, or any other type of data, make sure you code defensively, and guard against possibly unexpected data types.

You can now run the complete project and enjoy creating different polls.

To learn more about the different methods available in the Firestore SDK in Flutter, [visit the documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/usage).

# Update votes

Now that we have the power of type-safety to read Firestore collections, what about updating existing documents?

In this step we will add a voting method to each poll, which includes updating existing polls to reflect the new votes.

## Voting logic

Each user is authenticated anonymously and has a unique ID. When a user clicks on an answer in a poll to vote for it, we need to make sure that any user can vote once for any poll. Therefore, on each poll, we store a map of users, linking each user to an answer by its ID.

## Update nested fields in Firestore

In order to update `users` map, we need to update a field inside a map inside a document, this's a "nested field".

In Firestore, we can update nested fields easily using `update` method. Go to `TODO(1)`, and add the following method which updates the answer ID for a specific user:

```dart
Future<void> vote(String pollId, int answerId) async {
  final user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
  await _pollsRef.doc(pollId).update({'users.${user!.uid}': answerId});
}
```

Note how we used the same `_pollsRef` without any additional code to transform the poll object.

## Call `vote` from the UI

In `TODO(2)`, we will simply call `vote()` and pass it the poll ID and answer ID. If you try to vote on any poll now, you can see the text color changing to amber, indicating that this is the answer you voted for. Additionally, the votes count dynamically increases since your vote adds up to the users' collection.

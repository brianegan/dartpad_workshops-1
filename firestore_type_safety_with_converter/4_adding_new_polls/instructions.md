# Adding new polls

> üí° If you get stuck, click on the **‚ÄúShow Solution‚Äù** button below, then run the code to see the final result in this step.

Read, write... you're still missing `create`!

Let's add new polls and see how the converters you added previously on `_pollsRef` will make this step easy and clean.

Before going further, 2 new widgets has been added to help you in this step:
- Line `200`: `CreatePollButton` a custom button design with `onTap` callback.
- Line `236`: `NewPollSheet` a new page designed to create polls, with `onSave` callback that returns a new `Poll` object if all fields are valid.

## Call `add` on `_pollsRef`

Go to `TODO(1)`, and let's add the new poll to the database:

```dart
Future<void> createPoll(Poll poll) async {
  await _pollsRef.add(poll);
}
```

There's no need to call `toJson()` on the poll, you will simply pass it to `add`, since `toJson` has already been declared as the `toFirestore` property in `withConverter`, so no need to call it again.

## Creating new polls

The last step is to construct a new poll object from the data the user enters in `NewPollSheet`, then add it to Firestore. On `TODO(2)`, add the following code:

```dart
void onCreate() {
  if (formKey.currentState!.validate() && answersControllers.isNotEmpty) {
    // ADD FROM HERE
    Poll poll = Poll(
      answers: [
        for (int answerId in answersControllers.keys)
          Answer(
            id: answerId,
            text: answersControllers[answerId]!.text,
          ),
      ],
      question: questionController.text,
    );

    widget.onSave(poll);
    // TO HERE

    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  }
}
```

If you scroll up to `line 133`, we're calling `createPoll` from `PollsState` and giving it the newly constructed poll in the sheet.
